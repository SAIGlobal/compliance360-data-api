# Introduction
The Compliance 360 application is the leading Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) platform. The Compliance 360 system is a highly-configurable application framework underpinned by a metadata-driven architecture. 

The Data API provides developers with the ability to Create, Update, and Delete business objects within the Compliance 360 system. It also provides the ability to execute component operations, like the ability to checkout a policy or advance a workflow. In addition to the core data API features, this API also provides the ability to upload and download binary documents, like file attachments as well as retrieve the audit trail history of a component.
